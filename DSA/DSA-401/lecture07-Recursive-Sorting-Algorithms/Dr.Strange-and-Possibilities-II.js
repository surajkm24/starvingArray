// * Dr. Strange is back again and this time he has an array A with n integers which may have duplicates.
// * So he again uses his mind power and time stone to calculate all the possible subsets of the input array A.
// ? Generate all the possible subsets...
// ? Elements within the subset must be in non-decreasing order.
// ? All the subsets must be distinct and sorted lexicographically.
// ? For an empty subset just print a blank line...
